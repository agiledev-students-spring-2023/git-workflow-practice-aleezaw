[The Future of Software Development in 2023 and Beyond](https://www.netsolutions.com/insights/the-future-of-software-development/)

I found this article to be interesting and motivational as a student pursuing a technology career. It is obvious that technology only continues to advance and the need to find individuals to fill new roles and learn new skills is in full force. As new technologies and systems develop, there is a constant need to find individuals who are suitable. Even with the recent layoffs and job shortages, it is reassuring as a college senior to read an article like this, which emphasizes that the technology field is no doubt the right space to be in. Even after graduating, I will hopefully have many oppertunities to continue learning as new technology develops. One of the great things abouut the technology space is that there is always more to learn and new skills that can be aquired, which makes it so exciting and interesting. There is definetly work that has to be put in and oppertunities must be sought out, but that is just one step in the problem solving world that is computer science.
